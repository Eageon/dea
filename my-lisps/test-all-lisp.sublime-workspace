In your .emacs file:\n;;        (add-to-list 'load-path \"/dir/to/yasnippet.el\")\n;;        (require 'yasnippet)\n;;   2. Place the `snippets' directory somewhere.  E.g: ~/.emacs.d/snippets\n;;   3. In your .emacs file\n;;        (setq yas/root-directory \"~/.emacs/snippets\")\n;;        (yas/load-directory yas/root-directory)\n;;   4. To enable the YASnippet menu and tab-trigger expansion\n;;        M-x yas/minor-mode\n;;   5. To globally enable the minor mode in *all* buffers\n;;        M-x yas/global-mode\n;;\n;;   Steps 4. and 5. are optional, you don't have to use the minor\n;;   mode to use YASnippet.\n;;\n;;   Interesting variables are:\n;;\n;;       `yas/root-directory'\n;;\n;;           The directory where user-created snippets are to be\n;;           stored. Can also be a list of directories that\n;;           `yas/reload-all' will use for bulk-reloading snippets. In\n;;           that case the first directory the default for storing new\n;;           snippets.\n;;\n;;       `yas/mode-symbol'\n;;\n;;           A local variable that you can set in a hook to override\n;;           snippet-lookup based on major mode. It is a a symbol (or\n;;           list of symbols) that correspond to subdirectories of\n;;           `yas/root-directory' and is used for deciding which\n;;           snippets to consider for the active buffer.\n;;\n;;   Major commands are:\n;;\n;;       M-x yas/expand\n;;\n;;           Try to expand snippets before point.  In `yas/minor-mode',\n;;           this is bound to `yas/trigger-key' which you can customize.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas/load-directory\n;;\n;;           Prompts you for a directory hierarchy of snippets to load.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas/insert-snippet\n;;\n;;           Prompts you for possible snippet expansion if that is\n;;           possible according to buffer-local and snippet-local\n;;           expansion conditions.  With prefix argument, ignore these\n;;           conditions.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas/find-snippets\n;;\n;;           Lets you find the snippet files in the correct\n;;           subdirectory of `yas/root-directory', according to the\n;;           active major mode (if it exists) like\n;;           `find-file-other-window'.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas/visit-snippet-file\n;;\n;;           Prompts you for possible snippet expansions like\n;;           `yas/insert-snippet', but instead of expanding it, takes\n;;           you directly to the snippet definition's file, if it\n;;           exists.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas/new-snippet\n;;\n;;           Lets you create a new snippet file in the correct\n;;           subdirectory of `yas/root-directory', according to the\n;;           active major mode.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas/load-snippet-buffer\n;;\n;;           When editing a snippet, this loads the snippet.  This is\n;;           bound to \"C-c C-c\" while in the `snippet-mode' editing\n;;           mode.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas/tryout-snippet\n;;\n;;           When editing a snippet, this opens a new empty buffer,\n;;           sets it to the appropriate major mode and inserts the\n;;           snippet there, so you can see what it looks like.  This is\n;;           bound to \"C-c C-t\" while in `snippet-mode'.\n;;\n;;   The `dropdown-list.el' extension is bundled with YASnippet, you\n;;   can optionally use it the preferred \"prompting method\", puting in\n;;   your .emacs file, for example:\n;;\n;;       (require 'dropdown-list)\n;;       (setq yas/prompt-functions '(yas/dropdown-prompt\n;;                                    yas/ido-prompt\n;;                                    yas/completing-prompt))\n;;\n;;   Also check out the customization group\n;;\n;;        M-x customize-group RET yasnippet RET\n;;\n;;   If you use the customization group to set variables\n;;   `yas/root-directory' or `yas/global-mode', make sure the path to\n;;   \"yasnippet.el\" is present in the `load-path' *before* the\n;;   `custom-set-variables' is executed in your .emacs file.\n;;\n;;   For more information and detailed usage, refer to the project page:\n;;      http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/\n\n;;; Code:\n\n(require 'cl)\n(require 'assoc)\n(require 'easymenu)\n\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n;; User customizable variables\n\n\n(defgroup yasnippet nil\n  \"Yet Another Snippet extension\"\n  :group 'editing)\n\n;;;###autoload\n(defcustom yas/root-directory nil\n  \"Root directory that stores the snippets for each major mode.\n\nIf you set this from your .emacs, can also be a list of strings,\nfor multiple root directories.
